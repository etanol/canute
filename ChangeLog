	* Canute v1.2

	- Improved protocol, now propagating file modification time and executable
	bit information while maintaining backwards compatibility with older
	versions.
	- Makefile now detects the host platform and adjusts some
	compilation flags accordingly, so it is no longer necessary to
	perform tricks with non-gcc compilers.  Currently supported: Solaris
	and HP-UX.

	* Canute v1.1

	- Fixed a bug when giving multiple arguments on the command line.
	In some cases, the program did not return to the working directory
	correctly.
	- Progress bar now repaints at least every second, which reduces
	de number of repaints on fast connections.
	- Progress bar also can resize in the middle of a transfer.

	* Canute v1.0

	- Major version update, not backwards compatible due to
	changes in protocol.
	- Automatic resume support.
	- Large file support (> 2GBytes).
	- Some fatal errors now treated as non-fatal to gain
	robustness.
	- More UNIX flavours supported. Commercial ones tested are:
	Solaris, OSF1 (5.1) and HP-UX.
	- Split of the source file to improve code management and
	readability.
	- An informative README file added to the distribution.
	- Code licensed under GPLv2.

	on win32.

	* Canute v0.5

	- More detailed feedback before and after progress bar. Thanks
	to a small code redesign.
	- Stabilized speed and ETA values after some recoded parts in
	order to find and resolve a stability bug found when
	transmitting over slow connections.
	- Cleaned some unneeded conditional code (some #ifdef's supressed).

2006-06-27  mkd  <claudiomkd@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.4.1

	- Add a small workaround for ETA calculations when the file
	size is less than two megabytes.


2006-06-26  mkd  <claudiomkd@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.4

	- New feature: A mean speed is shown after each transfer.
	- New timer code for Windows using an equivalent to the Unix.
	gettimeofday().
	- Include some stability changes to the global timer code.
	- Some code clean-ups and remove non-necessary variables.

	* Canute v0.3

	- Fixed a small bug in the speed meter which made the whole
	progress bar to jump down a line and produced an ugly visual
	effect.

	* Canute v0.2

	- Improved feedback. Now we have a WGet style progress bar,
	most of the code was stolen from there anyway. The transmission
	speed and estimated time needs some improvements, basically
	stabilize the values.

	* Canute v0.1

	- First stable release with rudimentary feedback.
