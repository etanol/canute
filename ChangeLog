	* Canute v0.3

	- Fixed a small bug in the speed meter which made the whole
	progress bar to jump down a line and produced an ugly visual
	effect.

	* Canute v0.2

	- Improved feedback. Now we have a WGet style progress bar,
	most of the code was stolen from there anyway. The transmision
	speed and estimated time needs some improvements, basically
	stabilize the values.

	* Canute v0.1

	- First stable release with rudimentary feedback.
